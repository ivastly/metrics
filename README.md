# Metrics Demo

## Usage

- Install dependencies: `make`
- Be aware that composer is configured to ignore file system changes. You must run `make` each time you create, move, rename or delete files in `src`.
- Start the containers: `docker-compose up -d`
- Watch the client using the app: `docker-compose logs -f client`
- Open Grafana and add dashboards: http://localhost:3000
- Scale client application to 10 instances and watch the changes on the dashboard: `docker-compose up -d --scale client=10`
- Add more instrumentation
